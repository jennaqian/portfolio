# Hi, I'm Jenna! ðŸ‘‹

## I'm a passionate web developer with a strong background in data analytics and a love for creating intuitive, user-centered designs. I transitioned into tech through a coding fellowship at Pursuit, where I gained hands-on experience in JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and full-stack development.

## Currently, I'm focused on building engaging web applications and exploring data-driven solutions. I'm excited to keep learning, collaborating, and contributing to projects that have a positive impact.

### When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in food or travel adventures.
